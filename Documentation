To build an application using LangChain and Streamlit for insurance document classification and extraction, we will need a combination of: Document Classification & Information Extraction
Document Classification to identify the type of insurance document.
Information Extraction from the document based on its type(Car Insurance, Health Insurance, Home Insurance)
Firstly, we need to upload the document using Stramlit's file_uploader to allow users to upload insurance documents
Secondly, we use LangChain to classify the document type (e.g., Car insurance, Health Insurance) 
Then, depending on the document type,  we need to extract the relevant information such as insurer name, address, premium etc. 
Finally, the extracted information needs to be displayed. 
We have the function used in this application. Here is the brief explanation:
classify_document: This function uses LangChain to classify the document based on text input
extract_information: This function uses regular expression(re) to extract fields like insurer name, address, car, premium, etc. depending on the document type
Streamlit UI: The file_uploader allows users to upload their documents. The document type is then displayed, and the extracted information is shown in a formatted JSON block.
